# GameEngine_sfml
 
This is a repository for my first attempt at making a game engine with sfml.
The repository is not fully functional to duplicate and simply run, instead it is a source of reference for a possible solution to set up a game engine.

This project uses sfml as a foundation for the game engine to be built upon. If anyone wants to clone and run this project, try and get help from their web page on how to setup sfml.

This game engine is self-made without much guidance, though it draws inspiration heavily from the Unity game engine. It was made with a lot of trials and errors and might not be the best example of how a game engine is to be implemented, but it functions well as a personal learning environment for me and works fine for my personal use case.

There exists a debug build, SFML_Tutorial.exe file, that holds the latest build made with the project, which uses some parts of the engine and is easily playable.
